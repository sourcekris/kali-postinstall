Kali Post-Install
-----------------

A script to more easily setup a new Kali 2018.3a + w/MATE and Arc-theme and additional tools installed. 

Added add-to-panel.py which just simplifies adding bulk shortcuts to the Kali Mate top panel like in Kali 1.0 days :)

Tweet @CTFKris for ideas.

### Changelog

#### v2018.3a
 - Updated for Kali 2018.3a which comes with GTK 3.24

#### v2018.2

- Updated for Kali 2018.2 including GTK3.22 support.
- Thanks to Ubuntu, the GTK 3.21+ theme scene has stablised now so there's attractive themes available. Using Arc-theme now.

#### v2016.2

- Updated for Kali 2016.2 including GTK3.20 support.
- **Note**: GTK3.21 probably breaks the theme but is in the Kali rolling repo already. Be careful if running a apt-get upgrade.
